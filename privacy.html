    <p>This keyboard does not collect your input or connect to the network, even with "Allow Full Access" enabled. By default, full access is disabled, which means that the keyboard operates in complete isolation from the rest of your apps. You only need to enable full access if you want to hear keyboard clicks; this is an unfortunate limitation of the operating system, and you can rest assured that even with this setting enabled, none of your keystrokes are ever collected or sent over the network. The keyboard works perfectly fine even with full access off.</p>
